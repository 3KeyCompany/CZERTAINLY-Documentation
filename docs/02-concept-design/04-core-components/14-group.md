# Group

`Group` represents the logical grouping of certificates based on the common characteristics of certificates.

The `Group` may be based on:

- Department that is responsible to manage certificates
- Application that contains the same type of certificates
- Compliance requirements
- Discovery sources
- Certificate metadata

:::info
Multiple `Groups` can be created for easy management and visibility of certificates.
